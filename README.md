## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This project is the design of my portfolio web page. I achieved this by building on a portfolio template to get it looking as i desire.

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, to achieve this portfolio page so a basic understanding of these skill would be required if you want to try out something like this.

This portfolio consists of a homepage, an about page, a contact page and a page called porfolio.
In the portfolio page, there is a display of other projects i have worked on.
This portfolio consist of all the information required about me including my skill set, quailification, name and the services i can render.

## You would be able to:

View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
Where to find everything.

## Thank you.
